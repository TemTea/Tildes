Eyes dyed in sky, arms stretched then akimbo
I hope you don't hate when I reduce you to a symbol

Traced contours with a starmap and a fingertip
One amongst the Pleiades or handle of the Little Dip  

On that hill where greyed men argued like child kings
I played an instrument and you joined in to sing...

Far faint lights, through the void or silence
I still get to look to you for guidance.

In Hangman I taught her syzygy, and she taught me jazz
And how to avoid themes of Tower cards of our past
I brought up mentalism and the art of Cold Reading
She promised that there's something West of East of Eden

Memories like a sieve, fit for self-deceiving
But palm lines read, told of release from bleeding

After repeated graceful redirections
You get the hint to stop asking those sorts of questions
And after you stop asking those sort of questions
Maybe regret is what you're left with

Always vague on the specifics, but
It was just a matter of time before your light got eclipsed

Now parted by Pluto
A reflected truth showed
As if by the moon's glow--
Pops Jupiter to Juno
Brother was a bluenose
Fated for the hoosegow
An addled, violent, Bluto
Apogee to nadir, you would hid your true lows

Tidally locked you only showed your bright side
While I cherish memories running free in the night time
You'd fend off any offer of an offer a lifeline
Trauma taught a tether was a tool meant to bind

Your life's exegesis: support is a weakness
Any closeness an opening to pick apart your pieces
A crutch becomes prosthesis
Anything beyond your inner space only fit to lease--
It's sickness and I shared that thesis, that tendency to orbit
Up in the Oort cloud lending impulse to the torpid
An island in the company of four and twenty corvids
~~At measured distance we lent impulse to the torpid~~

Sure, we're all stardust.  Photos of Arbus
Fallen far afield from the target market
The raft we shipped the S.S. Shared Hardships
With little love of lucre or largesse
The bare-thread art kids, 
Hit spliffs, working red-eye shifts, 
But still emit that red light, drift (?)

After warehouse celebrations of Saturn
In descent you spy not the healthiest of patterns.

Ken closed eyes while in transit
Celestial smile that got occluded by the manic
The frantic panic of the passenger the next seat over 
Unable to impede a supernova

Signs open to early detection
dismissed as youthful indiscretion
Keep the company of masters of misdirection
It gets second nature, the habit of second-guessing

Heard about your death through a game of telephone
By the time we got the message you were long gone

I know your mass in your absence
Felt ~~Seen~~ it through a warping of the fabric
Clocks no longer track accurate
Time goes slow yet fast 
When memories you make just aren't lasting

I know what needs are inelastic
Found out when you collapsed in
Friends fractured to factions
I was less than last pick
Wondering exactly what it was that I'm lacking

Any joy is a distraction, comfort a malefaction
Each day you stay will eat away as it's delay of action
Up the tracks in a bath, slit

Dunno dude, guess I got survivors guilt
World keeps spinning just with axis tilt
An unhealthy epitaph, the excuse I'd draft:
Continuing with what you'd built

Dunno dude, I got abandonment baggage
Follows where I go but keep it stuffed in the attic.
On nights where there's low light pollution
I'll assemble it to get a view of something human

Still struggle with thoughts that my proximity is toxic, and yet
I miss your adjacency, through borrowed eyes I'd see that
Like life's a box of nascent seeds-- you made it breathe
Unsure what Scholomance or alchemy
You were a giving breed, big bro to me
The highest tree your canopy, shelter from the storms. 
Bi but never frosty connecting worlds like I'm Norse 
But the roots diseased, seen in rotten fruits and wilted leaves
A serpent lurks and eats, til replete with grief
You crossed a sea to keep from being seen weak
Hold your guts to keep them from falling free
Under that pressure the only escape was release

Or, the first time that we spoke alone it was to mend a broken wing
Set the tone that you're the type that tends to tend to wounded things
Beyond the scope of what you may be capable of handling.
Different person maybe, but suffers a shared malady.

Or, you called me up way late at night and demanded the move I choose
You'd make a cabin in the woods, needed: Irish, Chinese, Jew, ...
You stalked a girl, a family friend, when she danced it was just for you--
The quirks were taking on a darker hue

Or, you moved to Portland with your gal to build a life past parents pad, 
Fought the system in the streets, fist raised and shouting out ACAB.
Down with other people's problems, you'd fight all of the world's ills,
But something tripped you up and then you lost the battle with the pills.

Or, you slept up under Cobain's bridge,
Had a pace/energy that few could match.
Mercurial moods were got much,
When you died she got put on blast.

Or, your mom ran off with another man, your school life on arrival, dead
Your dad walked to the local park and put a bullet in his head
Now your sister was your ward, hope you're out their managing, but
Maybe you just passed it on, the pain that you'd been channeling

In that vein, the boy I babysat that'd later change his name
Afraid you'll be another crooked petal on the daisy chain
You liked Kerbal, airplanes and wrasslin'
But before adoption you'd been used as an ashbin

Sean you a spaceman, the energy and calm and patience--
To a kid [you were] unassuming and delightful
Some might say you were just too gentle,
I'd say your choice to go quiet to the night, though

To anyone that didn't make the list or couldn't fit the scheme
Anyone too distant for me to get their weights or histories:
Wish you were dealt a better hand
Wish you had had a better end
Wish I'd been a better man, a better friend
But wishing is for shooting stars
So I'll look up while writing bars

...and I don't want to in any way reduce you
But if I knew your essence I would bottle and mass produce you

My wabi-sabi kimosabes,
I would mint a million copies,
Often goofy, sometimes bawdry
Adds some value, not shit from Lockheed.
Bric-a-braks, knickknacks, gimcracks, and tchotchkes--
You'd find value in the motley.

...and I'm not ignoring the flaws beneath the surface,
But I've seen you at your best and that's what took purchase
Cut through thick city sussurus, 
Like life's better playing co-op not verseless,

Y'al had some musical souls
Apollonian lute trailing Sol
My never-subtle Suns, fuel to make those shuttle runs
Getting through the gibbous day and building up them bubble buns

Girl from a sunny world
You wore clothes that didn't fit
I'm a monster in a maze
Acting like a hypocrite
If you heard me talk that way
You would probably flip your shit
When I would self sabotage
Thought that I'd get that visit...

But I'm stuck here, terrestrial, 
Daily affirmations: I'm my favorite vegetable
What do you do for fun? Spelunking... in anhedonia
I'm a competitive ranked atoner

So I'll be a home loaner to avoid being a home aloner
A loam comber, that's growing my own Roma
A ruins of Rome roamer, skipping the owned Mona
Straight to the Dover, slopes to sober a coma
To make tombs for known soldier who shouldered undue boulders
Hewn from moonstone, my own soma
Code donor, Semi-tone blower
Play blue notes, make em smolder
Break a cycle, take the coda

If I escape the maze of Borges paved with ablution and abasement
I think I'll owe it to your constellations 
And if I way lose my way, stumble in a haze I'll use you for orientation

To all recipients unreachable, I appreciate each of you
Put on tea for two

Among [Siberian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia "Siberia") shamans, a central tree may be used as a ladder to ascend the heavens.
